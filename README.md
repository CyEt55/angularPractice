# AngularPractice

Front-End retrieved from Angular getting started tutorial, and connected to a Express Back-End.

UPDATE: A new Back-End has been generated with Visual Studio 2022 using EntityFrameworkCore, changed baseUrl in product service to match.

Using Sequelize ORM to connect to a self hosted PostgresSQL database.

UPDATE: the Express Back-End has been separated from this project for better visibilty.

Use the command *docker build -t yourdockerimage .* to use the Dockerfile and create an image of the project.
